          Once it is confirmed that you have a gastric ulcer diagnosis, certain
          lifestyle modifications form a key component of your treatment
          strategy.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-7">
          For instance, lowering body stress can aid with discomfort and
          healing. This is because individuals who are stressed may adopt
          unwholesome coping techniques, including binge drinking, smoking, or
          eating unhealthily, which may worsen gastric ulcers
        </p>

        <p className="mb-7">
          Besides stress levels, avoiding spicy, oily, and acidic meals can help
          you feel healthier. You may also discover that you have certain
          trigger foods which may irritate your bowel, produce too much acid, or
          give you heartburn. It is best to speak with your doctor to go over
          specifics since you might not have the same symptoms linked to foods
          as other people. <br />
          <br />
          Here are some additional tips to make the condition more manageable:
        </p>

        <ul className="ml-10 list-disc space-y-4">
          <li>
            Eating on a regular basis and in lesser servings can help to prevent
            overeating and lower gastrointestinal pressure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain drugs may aggravate the issue by irritating the stomach
            lining, hence, it is important to get a doctor's prescription before
            going on any medication regimen.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            Avoid wearing restrictive clothing; instead, pick stretchable
            materials and comfortable items to keep you comfortable if you
            frequently feel bloated.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </main>
