        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is it?</h3>
        <p className="mb-7">
          Gastric ulcer is a hole or rupture in the gut or along the intestinal
          wall in the stomach. It often appears as sores.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Causes</h3>
        <p className="mb-7">
          It is caused by a bacterium specie known as Helicobacter pylori, which
          is normally present in the stomach in minimal amounts. Your stomach
          tissue may be compromised, however, when this bacterium is present in
          large amounts, causing a formation of sores and intense pain. It can
          also be triggered by certain lifestyle habits such as smoking,
          drinking alcohol.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Signs & Symptoms</h3>
        <p className="mb-7">
          Some symptoms you may experience if you have ulcer are bloody stools,
          bloated stomach, nausea, feeling nauseous or dizzy, intense stomach
          pain amongst others. Complications such as bleeding at the site of the
          ulcer can also occur when it is left undiagnosed for a while. Many
          medical conditions have common symptoms so a consultation with a
          doctor should be done to confirm the diagnosis.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          Treatment will depend on the severity of the ulcer. Antacids,
          antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors such as Omeprazole can be
          taken either individually or combined as directed by a medical doctor.
